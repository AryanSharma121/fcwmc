The BS handles radio communication and is controlled by a Base Station Controller (BSC). MSC manages switching, roaming, and billing. Cellular networks use frequency reuse to maximize spectrum. Handover transfers active calls between cells. GSM uses hard handover (‘break before make’), while CDMA uses soft handover (‘make before break’).”",
