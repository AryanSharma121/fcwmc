Passage  
“A mobile communication system consists of Mobile Station (MS), Base Station (BS), and Mobile Switching 
Center (MSC). MS includes mobile equipment and SIM card. The BS handles radio communication and is 
controlled by a Base Station Controller (BSC). MSC manages switching, roaming, and billing. Cellular networks

Passage
Guided media are physical channels such as cables/wires through which data is transmitted in a network. Types 
include twisted pair cable (UTP and STP), coaxial cable, and optical fiber. UTP is common in LANs, while STP 
provides extra shielding. Coaxial cable, used in TV and broadband, offers better shielding and bandwidth. Optical 
fiber, made from silica glass, transmits data with light at very high speeds and with immunity to electromagnetic 
interference. There are single-mode (long distance) and multimode (short distance) fiber types.
